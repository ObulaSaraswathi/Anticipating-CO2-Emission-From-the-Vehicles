# Anticipating-CO2-Emission-From-the-Vehicles
🚗 Anticipating CO₂ Emission from Vehicles
This project is a Flask web application that predicts CO₂ emissions for vehicles based on user input such as engine size, fuel type, and other features. The goal is to help raise awareness and enable users to make informed decisions to reduce carbon footprints.
